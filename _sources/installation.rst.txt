Installation
============

Orrery is available for download from PyPI. Please follow the instructions
below. The use of Python virtual environments is optional, but highly
recommended.

.. code-block:: console

   # (Optional) Create a new python virtual environment
   $ python -m venv venv

   # (Optional) Activate virtual environment (on MacOS/Linux)
   $ ./venv/bin/activate

   # (Optional) Activate virtual environment (on Windows)
   $ ./venv/Scripts/activate

   # Install using pip!
   (venv)$ pip install orrery

Run the following command in the console to ensure that everything was
installed properly. It should return "orrery" followed by the most recent
version number uploaded to PyPI.

.. code-block:: console

    $ orrery --version

Now you're ready to start creating your own simulations!
