"""
samples/using_events.py

Events are core to the reactivity of the simulation. They alert other systems that
something significant has occurred. Simulation authors can tap into these events
to make cascading effects.

In this example, we add one character to the simulation and track the amount of money
they have. When they accumulate enough money from their job, we emit an event
saying they became a millionaire. We then read that event in another system that
decrements money from the character (presumably because they need to pay taxes).

Events disappear at the end of the timestep. So, the event will not fire again until
the character has enough money.
